# Recommendation_Systems


In this project, we have created two models simultaneously: basic KNN with Pearson Similarity and KNN with Means with Cosine Similarity. We introduced a manual example and then calculated the RMSE metrics to assess the prediction accuracy of the models. Based on the results obtained, the KNN with means has better prediction accuracy, with the value closer to 0, hence closer to the actual user data. It would be advisable to also calculate some other metrics to confirm these results.
